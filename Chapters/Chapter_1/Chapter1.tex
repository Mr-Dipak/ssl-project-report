\section{Existing System and Need for System}

\subsection{Current SSL Certificate Management Challenges}

Traditional SSL certificate management involves several manual processes that are time-consuming and error-prone:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Manual Certificate Generation}: Administrators must manually generate CSRs (Certificate Signing Requests), validate domain ownership, and configure certificates on servers.
    
    \item \textbf{DNS Validation Complexity}: DNS-01 challenge validation requires manual creation and cleanup of TXT records, leading to potential configuration errors.
    
    \item \textbf{Certificate Renewal Management}: Tracking expiration dates and renewing certificates before they expire requires constant monitoring and manual intervention.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Domain Management}: Managing certificates for multiple domains across different DNS providers becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming.
    
    \item \textbf{Deployment Inconsistencies}: Manual certificate deployment often leads to configuration inconsistencies across different server environments.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Industry Requirements}

Modern web applications require:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automated SSL certificate generation and renewal
    \item Support for wildcard certificates through DNS validation
    \item Integration with multiple DNS providers
