\section{Proposed System}

The SSL Automation Tool is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to automate the entire lifecycle of SSL certificate management. The system consists of two main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Application}: A React-based web interface providing user-friendly certificate management
    \item \textbf{Backend API}: A FastAPI-based service handling SSL certificate operations and Let's Encrypt integration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Architecture Overview}

The proposed system follows a modern microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns (detailed component diagram is provided in Chapter 3):

\subsubsection{Frontend Layer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Interface}: Modern React-based SPA with responsive design
    \item \textbf{State Management}: Local component state with React hooks
    \item \textbf{API Communication}: Axios-based HTTP client with error handling
    \item \textbf{Authentication}: Token-based authentication (future enhancement)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Backend Layer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{API Gateway}: FastAPI framework with automatic documentation
    \item \textbf{Business Logic}: Certificate generation and management services
    \item \textbf{External Integrations}: Let's Encrypt ACME and DNS provider APIs
    \item \textbf{File Management}: Certificate storage and retrieval system
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Infrastructure Layer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Containerization}: Docker-based deployment with volume persistence
    \item \textbf{DNS Integration}: GoDaddy API for automated DNS challenge validation
    \item \textbf{Certificate Authority}: Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
    \item \textbf{Storage}: Persistent volumes for certificate and configuration files
\end{itemize}
